### üëãüèΩ Hello, World. 
I'm FarewellNehir. I'm the founder & executive CEO @MybuttonCorporation, being the developer, designer and manager at one point in this company ever since I started it in 2017.
We've provided the world with excessive and powerful tools, modules and basic programs for years, and we see no stop.
I hope to one day be someone who will be remembered, and be the first person to come to mind for the word 'Revolution'.
